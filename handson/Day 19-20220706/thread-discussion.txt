multi-threading
	windows - multi-tasking
	unix-family-linux - multi-processing 
	
	process ? 
		program become executable 
		"executable program in running"
	thread ? 
		---------------------------------
		API for multithreading 
		POSIX - multithreading 
		now, c 11/c+ 11 // Concurrency support library
			POSIX like multithreading API is rewritten for c / c++ users 
			now, multi-threading is part of the c / c++ stanandard
			
		---------------------------------
		thread 
			- execution model 
			- "routine runs independently"
		----------------------------------
		every process will have atleast one thread 
		
		
		suppose programmer wants to make a routine(function) 
		as another thread 
		
		now two threads - multithreading 
			one is default(process) thread 
			another one is programmer defined thread 
		
		multithreading will be handled by operating system 
----------------------------------

1. Two routines(functions) - non-threaded
2. Two routines(functions) - threaded
