	Arjun, Pooja, Suma, Sai Ram
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Airline Reservation System aims to automate the flight ticketing/seat booking
and confirmation system of an Airline company. The software is providing options for
viewing different flights available at different timing for a specific day. That provides
customers within the facility with the ability to book tickets smoothly. The customers can
modify and are able to cancel the ticket for any reason. That prepares within a role and
policies. The software should provide an option for checking the availability of the tickets.
That is important for the customers to get messages if the ticket is unavailable. That will be
displayed to customers. The customers should be noted when the change has been made or
any further changes. He or she can book accommodation if required.

Note:
Use of C language concepts such as pointers, dynamic array using DMA(no-memory leak), advanced pointers such as double pointer, function pointer, static library, macro constant, macro function, macro oprators, conditional preprocessor, binary file streams, linked list, mutli threading (threads, RACE FIX, MUTEX, COND VAR). And use effectively development tools such as makefile, gcc, gdb, valgrind, gprof, splint, UML tool such as draw.io, and git/github.

EMPLOYEE - PROJECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
	Sharanukumar, Narosh Mathew, Sai Avulakunta, Mounica
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goals of the project are:
The employee-project management system has been designed and developed to manage the
process project details{project id, project name, start date, end date, no of resources required, no
of resources allocated, project status} and employee details{emp id, emp name, emp status,
gender, basic salary, bonus, project details}. In the employee object, the number of projects being
allocated are a maximum of three projects with allocation information{project id, allocation start
date, allocation end date, role, percentage allocated).
In order to add / delete the employee, the administrator has a built-in login id and password set.
There may be any number of administrators. Here, in the employee details entry, the employee id
is auto generated. All employee details should be captured. The administrator is allowed to add
projects.The project id is auto generated. All project details should be captured. The end date
should be atleast one month after the start date. The administrator is allowed to allocate the
projects to the resource(employee). Once a resource is allocated to a project, update the count.
The project status is by default active. It will be set as "closed" manually. Resources
cannot be allocated to closed projects. An employee can be allocated to a max of 3 projects. The
sum of allocation percentage of all the projects should be 100. As soon as an employee is
allocated to 3 projects or allocation percentage sum is 100, the employee is marked as allocated.
The employee is given a user id and password. The employee can login and see his/her details
including employment and project

	Aniprada, Sai Ram, Mounica, Arya 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Online Cab Booking System is developed to manage all cab hiring work online.
Using this system it is very easy for customer to book a car. It is an online system through
which customers can view available cabs; register the cabs, view profile and book cabs.
Mostly peoples use cab service for their daily transportations need. Cab booking can also
check which car is free for booking and which cars are on booking at present time. The
objective and scope of my project Online Cab booking System is to record the details
various activities of user. It will simplify the task and reduce the paper work. Using this cab
booking management system car owner can also become partner of car booking agency by
giving their car for booking. Online Cab management system is a web based application that
allow users to book a car online. User can book cars and admin can confirm the booking and
cancel the booking on the basis of availability of the cars and drivers.
The booking order and to call the car driver to check their availability with their car if
they manage to find a car for booking they confirm the order otherwise they cancel the order
as they have no car for the booking.
This process waste a lot of time of customer and also of car booking agency and it
also give bad name to the agency but with our system car agency can confirm the order
within a minute by checking the availability of cars for booking. So this car booking system
is helpful to ease customerâ€™s task whenever they need to rent a cab or hire a cab.
